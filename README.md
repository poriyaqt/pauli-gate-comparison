# Pauli Gates Comparison: X, Y, and Z in Quantum Computing
This project compare the effects of Pauli gates (X, Y, Z) on a qubit in superposition.
Hadamard gate creates the superposition,followed by a Pauli gate,with results visualized through circuit diagrams,measurement histograms,and Bloch sphere repersentation.
